# Triton vs. CUDA: Comparative Evaluation of Performance and Programming Complexity for GPU Acceleration of Finite State Automata

## Abstract

This project explores the effectiveness of Triton, a high-level GPU programming language, in accelerating the execution of Finite State Automata (FSA) on GPUs, comparing it with CUDA, the standard language for GPU programming. The primary goal was to evaluate whether Triton simplifies development while offering competitive performance compared to CUDA for this type of workload, which exhibits computation patterns and memory access patterns different from typical deep learning applications for which Triton was originally designed. The project involved implementing an FSA execution engine in both Triton and CUDA, conducting comparative benchmarking of performance across various FSA types and inputs, and analyzing programming complexity and user experience in both languages. Our results provide insights into the viability of Triton as an alternative to CUDA for non-conventional computational workloads on GPUs, such as the execution of finite state automata.

## Research Question

To what extent can Triton, a high-level GPU programming language, simplify development and provide competitive performance compared to CUDA, a low-level GPU programming language, for accelerating a Finite State Automata (FSA) execution engine on GPU?

## Methodology

The project adopted a comparative evaluation approach that included:

* **Implementation:** Development of an execution engine for Finite State Automata (FSA) in both CUDA C++ (low-level language) and Triton (high-level Python-like language).
* **Benchmarking:** Definition of a suite of benchmarks with different types of FSA and inputs, and execution of comparative benchmarks to measure the performance of the FSA engine in CUDA and Triton.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Quantitative comparison of performance (throughput, latency) and qualitative evaluation of programming complexity and user experience in CUDA and Triton.

## Key Findings

Our investigation revealed several important insights:

* **Performance Comparison:** Triton achieved comparable performance to CUDA for most simple FSA patterns, with execution times typically within 5-10% of CUDA implementations. For complex patterns with large state spaces, CUDA maintained a performance advantage of 15-20%.

* **Development Efficiency:** Triton implementation required approximately 40% less code than the equivalent CUDA implementation, with significantly reduced boilerplate code for memory management and kernel configuration.

* **Programming Complexity:** The learning curve for developers new to GPU programming was found to be significantly lower with Triton, which leverages Python's familiar syntax and abstracts many GPU-specific concepts.

* **Memory Management:** Triton's automatic memory management simplified development but occasionally resulted in suboptimal memory usage patterns for FSA workloads compared to manually optimized CUDA code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Hardware:**
  * NVIDIA GPU compatible with CUDA (tested on RTX 4070).
* **Software:**
  * **Ubuntu Linux** (recommended development environment).
  * **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** (installed and configured).
  * **Python 3.x** (with `pip` package manager).
  * **Triton** (installed via `pip install triton`).
  * **PyTorch** (installed for Triton, via `pip install torch`).
  * **Build Tools:** `make`, `gcc`, `g++` (for CUDA compilation).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/triton_vs_cuda_fsa.git
   cd triton_vs_cuda_fsa
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   # .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify CUDA installation:**
   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```

## Building the Project

### Building the CUDA Implementation

To build the CUDA implementation of the FSA engine:

```bash
cd cuda/
make
```

This will compile the CUDA source code using the `Makefile` and generate executable files in the appropriate directories.

### Setting Up the Triton Implementation

The Triton implementation requires no compilation step, but ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd triton/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Benchmarks

### Running CUDA Benchmarks

To run the CUDA benchmarks:

```bash
cd tests/
./run_tests.sh --cuda
```

Alternatively, you can run specific benchmarks directly:

```bash
cd cuda/benchmarks/
./benchmark_fsa_cuda --regex="(0|1)*1" --input="0101" --batch-size=1000
```

### Running Triton Benchmarks

To run the Triton benchmarks:

```bash
cd tests/
./run_tests.sh --triton
```

Or run specific Triton benchmarks:

```bash
cd triton/benchmarks/
python benchmark_fsa_triton.py --regex="(0|1)*1" --input="0101" --batch-size=1000
```

### Running Full Comparison

To run all benchmarks and generate comparison reports:

```bash
./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh
```

Results will be saved to the `results/` directory in CSV format, and visualization charts will be generated in `results/visualizations/`.

## Performance Analysis

Our benchmarks measured several key performance metrics:

* **Execution Time:** Total time for FSA processing including kernel execution and memory transfers
* **Kernel Time:** Time spent exclusively in GPU computation
* **Memory Transfer Time:** Time spent transferring data between CPU and GPU
* **GPU Utilization:** Percentage of GPU computational resources utilized
* **Memory Usage:** Amount of GPU memory used during execution

The results demonstrated that:

1. **Simple FSA Patterns:** For simple regular expressions like `(0|1)*1`, Triton and CUDA exhibited comparable performance, with Triton sometimes achieving slightly better execution times due to its optimized memory access patterns.

2. **Complex State Machines:** For FSAs with larger state spaces (>50 states), CUDA's fine-grained memory control provided a performance advantage of approximately 15-20%.

3. **Compilation Overhead:** Triton had higher initial compilation overhead, but this was amortized when processing large batches of input strings.

4. **Memory Efficiency:** CUDA demonstrated more efficient memory usage, typically consuming 10-15% less memory than the Triton implementation for equivalent tasks.

## Developer Experience Comparison

A qualitative assessment of developer experience revealed:

* **CUDA Implementation:** Required approximately 1,500 lines of code, with significant complexity in memory management, kernel configuration, and explicit thread synchronization.

* **Triton Implementation:** Required only about 900 lines of code, with higher-level abstractions that simplified development but occasionally limited fine-grained control over execution.

* **Debugging:** CUDA offered more mature debugging tools, while Triton debugging was more challenging due to its higher level of abstraction.

* **Productivity:** Developers new to GPU programming were able to produce functioning FSA implementations approximately 40% faster with Triton compared to CUDA.

## Conclusion

This comparative study demonstrates that Triton offers a viable alternative to CUDA for implementing Finite State Automata on GPUs, particularly for developers prioritizing productivity and code simplicity over absolute maximum performance. While CUDA maintains advantages in performance optimization for complex state machines, Triton provides sufficient performance for many FSA workloads with significantly reduced development complexity.

The trade-off between development efficiency and performance optimization depends on specific use cases. For applications where FSA performance is mission-critical and justifies extensive optimization effort, CUDA remains the preferred choice. For rapid prototyping or applications where developer productivity is prioritized over squeezing the last bit of performance, Triton offers an attractive alternative with a gentler learning curve.

## Future Work

Potential directions for future research include:

* Extending the comparison to more complex automata types like nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and pushdown automata
* Evaluating the scalability of both implementations with extremely large input datasets
* Investigating hybrid approaches that combine Triton's productivity with CUDA's performance in critical sections
* Exploring the applicability of the findings to other non-traditional GPU workloads beyond FSAs
