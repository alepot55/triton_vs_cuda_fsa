    Placeholder function for FSA (Finite State Automaton) execution.
    This is a simplified version that always accepts the input string
    without using actual Triton kernel execution.
    
    In a real implementation, this would launch a Triton kernel to process the FSA,
    but for this placeholder, we'll simply set the output directly.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    fsa_ptr: Pointer to FSA representation (placeholder for now)
    input_string_ptr: Pointer to the input string (placeholder for now)
    output_ptr: Pointer to the output (boolean indicating acceptance)
    input_len: Length of the input string
    fsa_num_states: Number of states in the FSA
    fsa_num_symbols: Number of symbols in the FSA alphabet
    fsa_start_state: Initial state of the FSA
    num_accepting_states: Number of accepting states
    grid_size: Size of the grid for parallel execution
